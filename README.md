# Download data from HIEv and process

Here, I download soil variable data (e.g. moisture, temperature, TDR measurements etc...) at FACE from [HIEv](https://hiev.uws.edu.au/). Then I process them for later analyses and also created graphs. 

Firstly, you need to sign up HIEv in order to download files from there and get your own Token which will be used as your key to have access to HIEv. How to download HIEv files is described in detail on Remko's website (https://bitbucket.org/remkoduursma/hiev).
